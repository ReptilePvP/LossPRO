I am needing help with an idea for a project that I could use at my job. I work as a loss prevention surveillance .
I walk around a store & write down a time stamp & someone's description & what I think they store. 
So I am wanting to create a new program / project. Here is a few key things:

*Hardware Notes
 - M5Stack CoreS3 
 - M5Stack Dual Button Unit provides two independent buttons
 - M5Stack Key Unit provides single press functionality

*Arduino IDE will be used to upload the code
The follow library's will be used :

#include "lv_conf.h"
#include <FastLED.h>
#include <M5Unified.h>
#include <lvgl.h> ( Version 8.4.0 ) 
#include <M5GFX.h>
#include <Preferences.h>

Project Idea: Loss Prevention Logger
Features:

Timestamps: Automatically log the current time when a button is pressed.
Predefined Descriptions: Use the M5Stack Key Unit to select from predefined descriptions like "Male," "Female," "Hoodie," "Backpack," etc.
Custom Notes: Use the touchscreen of the CoreS3 to write quick custom notes.
Save Data: Store the logs in a CSV file on an SD card or send them via Wi-Fi to a centralized database.
Real-Time Alert: A combination of button presses on the Dual Button Unit could mark an event as critical, triggering a vibration or notification.

Display Logs on the CoreS3:

Show a live list of events with timestamps, descriptions, and notes.
Option to review or edit previous entries.
Export/Share Data:

Automatically sync the data to your phone or computer when connected to Wi-Fi.

Here is idea of an how I would want it to operate


Whenever a entry is recorded it will automatically have a time step of the date & current time in EST
Create new entry or view latest ones if user selects create new entry then the following menu select will be displayed 

Choose gender 
Male
Female
Once selected 
Then user will be prompt with prefilled options to select the color of the shirt
white 
Black
Blue
Yellow
Green
Orange
Pink
Red
grey

Once selected it will then draw the same thing as the shirt menu but instead for pants

& then once selected then the same but for the shoe color

Once selected then it will ask for what they think they stole
jewelry 
Woman shoes
Men shoes
Cosmeticâ€™s
Fregerances
Home
Kids
Then will ask to confirm the following entry & will show the users selected options. The user can then click confirm or Cancel. 

If selected Confirm results to uploading entry to a database ( if WiFi is connected ) or will save to SD. Then will take the user back to the main menu again 

If user clicks cancel then the user is taken back to the main menu 

Can you please create this using lvgl 8.4.0
